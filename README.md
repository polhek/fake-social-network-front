# The Odinbook - fake social network

Frontend for my "fake" social network app called **The Odinbook**. It is basically a rough copy
of facebook made for learning purposes of building REST API with NodeJS, with Facebook Authentication and JWT tokens for securing the REST API routes. I also made it using Typescript for the sake of learning a new language.

## Technology used

### Frontend

1. ReactJS with Typescript

2. TailwindCSS

3. Redux Toolkit

4. Axios,

5. and many more...

### Backend

1. NodeJS with ExpressJS framework

2. MongoDB (Mongoose)

3. PassportJS

4. oAuth

5. and many more...

## RestAPI - repository

- [REST API - NodeJS link](https://github.com/polhek/fake-social-network-api)

## To make app work:

You need to provide in your .env file:

- REACT_APP_FB_ID
- and in index.tsx file, you need to add your default url of backend (API server).
